# GFlowNet in PyTorch

![gflownet](images/gflownet_anim.gif)

This repo contains an implementation of the Generative Flow Net (GFlowNet) architecture proposed by Bengio et al. in the paper ["Flow Network based Generative Models for Non-Iterative Diverse Candidate Generation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04399) (2021).

The code is still a work in progress.
